In the latest iTunes release, there has been quite a few tweaks to the interface. One option that has moved is the change view in playlist. This post describes how to change this.<!--more-->

The latest version defaults all playlist views to “playlist”, which is fine for most people, but I am not a fan of cover art so the “songs view” (which is basically a list) is my favorite.

To change this click on “View” &gt; “View as” &gt; “Songs”. After songs is selected, you should see just a list of songs.
